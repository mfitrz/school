I believe that my buildMap function has a Big O of O(Nlog(n)). This is because it is a while loop that depends on the length of the file which then adds words to vectors (n) and the map (log(n)). The second for loop in that function is also O(N) which adds up to 2N which is O(n) for the whole function.
I believe that my generateText function has a Big O of O(N^2log(n)). This is because the for loop has another for loop inside of it which merits O(n^2). The second loop comes out to O(Nlog(n)) and the third loop comes out to O(n), but the worst loop is O(N^2log(n)). Thus, the function has O(N^2log(n)) complexity.
