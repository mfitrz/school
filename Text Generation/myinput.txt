A thousand faces A thousand places A hundred cases Forcing me to break My mind is racing I keep on chasing All these dreams That will never end But here we are Still fighting Creating Circles and squares And here we are Still writing Rewriting The story that never ends And here we are Still writing Rewriting The story that never ends While the world starts to crumble
I'm looking for diamonds in the rubble
It won't tear me down
No it won't tear me down
When the desert freezes over
You and me were moving closer
It won't tear us down
No it won't tear us down
Look at the stars tonight
Leaving the dark behind
For a brand new day
For a brand new day
Even the wrong seems right
Colored in black and white
On this brand new day
On this brand new day
(It won't tear us down, no it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down, no it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down, no it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down, no it won't tear us down)
Look at the stars tonight
Leaving the dark behind
For a brand new day
For a brand new day
Even the wrong seems right
Colored in black and white
On this brand new day
On this brand new day
Stuck here
With these
Clouds inside my head

Can't see
Back these
Words that I have said

Oh help me, oh help me, out here
Oh tell me, oh tell me, you care
’Cause I'm lost in hyperspace
Just want to get away
From the shit I have to face
I worry about yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yes- yes- yes- yes-, yesterday
I can't escape, I can’t escape oh I
I can't escape, oh break me free
I can't escape, I can't escape oh I
I can't escape, oh break me free
'Cause I'm lost in hyperspace
Just want to get away
From the shit I have to face
I worry about yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yes- yes- yes- yes-, yesterday
I'm lost in hyperspace
Just want to get away
From the shit I have to face
I worry about yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yes- yes- yes- yes-, yesterday
There is light on the edge of the dark side
That illuminates the sea
These thousand pretty colors
Will set us free
But how can we, survive the edge of glory
'Cause we are not afraid
We’re fighting for a better place
This world will fade away
Awaaay, this world will fade
Awaaay, this world will fade
Away (this world will fade away)
So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
We survived the edge of the dark side
And we illuminate the sea
We are the thousand pretty colors
That set us free
But how can we, survive the edge of glory
'Cause we are not afraid
We're fighting for a better place
This world will fade away
Awaaay, this world will fade away
So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
(The edge of glory!)
I know you know I care for honesty
You're the only one I see
The time we had, the days we spent
The world you promised me
We are only lovers in disguise
Keep playing pretend but it doesn't feel right
Masquerade, we can't escape
It's my shelter, your hideaway
Break these chains and release me
From this masquerade
Release me
Release me
From this masquerade
You know I go 'cause this is getting deep
It's better if you just leave
Take off your mask and face reality
What you trying to achieve?
Masquerade, we can't escape
It's my shelter, your hideaway
Break these chains and release me
From this masquerade
From this masquerade
From this masquerade
From this masquerade
From this masquerade
Release me
Release me
From this masquerade
Down in the dark, so bad to myself
Shattered my heart, can't blame no one else
’Cause I took the fall, I went too far
Myself of them all, now have to wear the scars
I'm broken, so hollow
I don't know who I’ll be tomorrow
No control, no halo
I'm the villain, you can be the hero
I'm the villain, you can be the hero
You'll be heaven, I'll be hell
Can you save me from myself
You'll be heaven, I'll be hell
Somebody save me from my-, can you stay because I'm
I’m broken, so hollow
I don’t know who I'll be tomorrow
No control, no halo
I’m the villain, you can be the hero (you can be the hero)
I'm broken, so hollow
I don't know who I'll be tomorrow
No control, no halo
I’m the villain, you can be the hero
I'm broken, so hollow
I don't know who I'll be tomorrow
No control, no halo
I'm the villain, you can be the hero
Stairs upon the temple, I climb and I crawl
Wonder how much further I'll go
Feet that fall apart till I walk on my ankles
Can I finish? I just don't know

People travel millions of miles just to see it
But they never conquer this way
I can tell them the greatest gains have conditions
But they're too far to hear what I say

Stairs upon the temple, I climb and I crawl
Wonder how much further I'll go
Fire is burning all around
Ashes falling to the ground
Someone save me, set me free
The smoke, it settles on my skin
Don't play with fire, you'll never win
Someone save me, help me breathe [3x]

Fire

Fire spreading everywhere
I feel we're running out of air
Someone save me, set me free
This love was cursed, long ago
It never had the chance to grow
Someone save me, help me breathe

Fire
Awake in this night
No voice, can't go back there
These scars say it all
(Say it all)

I'm breathing in
Still breathing in
I'm breathing in
Acceptance I'm exhaling

I'm breathing in
Acceptance I'm exhaling

Still breathing in

Acceptance I'm exhaling
Cruising with the ghouls
Ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm way to confused and abused
Yeah, I'm in too deep, yeah
Just way too deep, yeah

Heaven don't want me
Hell can't hold me
Wise man once told me:
Don't lose your way
Don't lose your way, son!
But now I'm drunk with a gun

I'm falling down, down, down
Can't get my feet off the ground
It's going way too far
Suicidal superstar

I'm falling down, down, down
Can't turn this shit around
I'm about to crash this car
Suicidal superstar

Suicidal 
Sui-

The world is not as it should be
It's filled with distortion
The world is not as it should be
It's filled with distortion
And ruin can no longer be avoided
Those who oppose fate and desire change
Now is the time to rise against the abyss of distortion

nothing left inside
Drowning, in a sea of lie
Struggling, juggling, keeping appearances up
But tonight we forget and we live like tomorrow is gone, 'cause
We are the young ones, the wild and the free
The dreamers delight when nothing's ever as it seems
We are the fighters, no place for the weak
We are the army of the hearts that never leave
We are invincible, unstoppable, the night's still young
We are the ones that never leave
High, after all time low
Done, taking all the blows
No struggling, juggling, keeping appearances up
Tonight we forget and we live like tomorrow is gone, 'cause
We are the young ones, the wild and the free
The dreamers delight when nothing's ever as it seems
We are the fighters, no place for the weak
We are the army of the hearts that never leave
We have been walking just to stay afloat
Help from the hand alongside a broken road
Tell me, where is my hope?
Let's go

Wandered off and got lost inside
Took the time to go back to life
Memories are my remedies
Engulf in a sound that I call my guide
Fall, fail, learn and earn
Fade always my concern
Before I burn I take a turn
'Cause we are home
Took the long way down alone
And I feel that there is no place like
The avenue of rendez-vous
'Cause we are home
Took the long way down alone
And I feel that there is no place like
The avenue of rendez-vous
Let's go
Let's go
I stand and withstand the trouble I find
The road is cold but I hold fire
Desire to take me higher
Take me higher, take me higher
I traveled these broken roads
I unraveled unspoken codes
Only memories can carry me
As long as I have the key
'Cause we are home
Took the long way down alone
And I feel that there is no place like
The avenue of rendez-vous
Let's go
I will strike you down
Feel me all around
Send me down, send me down
As I tear you apart

I will strike you down (down, down, down)
I will strike you down

I will strike you down
Feel me all around
Send me down, send me down
As I tear you apart

I will strike you down (down, down, down)
I will strike you down

(I will strike you) 

I will strike you down
Feel me all around
Send me down, send me down
As I tear you apart

I will strike you down
Feel me all around
Send me down, send me down
As I tear you apart
My light is turning black tonight
Too many echoes in my mind
It's hard to tell my left from right
We in a rat race but we gotta keep
Running, running, non-stop we are
Running, running, no sleep we're
Dashing, laughing, nobody can
Hold us down
We all, rise when we fall
Keep it going
Three six five, twenty-four seven
Three six five, twenty-four seven
And go, break down these walls
Keep it going
Three six five, twenty-four seven
Three six five, twenty-four seven
Wanna be found but we are lost
And pay the price at any cost
Don't really know where we belong
It doesn't matter 'cause we never stop
Running, running, non-stop we are
Running, running, no sleep we're
Dashing, laughing, nobody can
Hold us down
We all, rise when we fall
Keep it going
Three six five, twenty-four seven
Three six five, twenty-four seven
And go, break down these walls
Keep it going
Three six five, twenty-four seven
Three six five, twenty-four seven
We don't stop, we don't stop
We go three six five, twenty-four seven
We don't stop, we never stop
We go three six five, twenty-four seven (twenty-four seven)
We don't stop, we don't stop
We go three six five, twenty-four seven
We don't stop, we never stop
We go three six five, twenty-four seven
Sapphire blue
The water pulls me back everytime I leave
And I know it's you
I should stay away 'cause you run from me but I don't
I like drowning out my troubles
I like floating with my eyes closed
But I'm setting to a new low
Once again I am swimming with the sharks
Who's gonna save me?
Once again I am lost, I've gone too far
Who's gonna save me?
'Cause I jumped in too deep
In a raging sea
I am swimming with the sharks
Who's gonna save me?
'Cause I jumped in too deep
In a raging sea
I am swimming with the sharks
Smell my fear
Now the enemy is circling around
Thought the coast was clear
Should do anything just to get me out but I don't
I like drowning out my troubles
I like floating with my eyes closed
But I'm setting to a new low
Once again I am swimming with the sharks
Who's gonna save me?
Once again I am lost, I've gone too far
Who's gonna save me?
'Cause I jumped in too deep
In a raging sea
I am swimming with the sharks
Who's gonna save me?
Looking around
Seeing their faces, they're judging me
I'm feeling proud
And I don't seem to know what to say
Waiting, waiting
My heart is aching
I am screaming out
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Waiting, waiting
My heart is aching
I am screaming out
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Waiting, waiting
My heart is aching
I am screaming out
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care!
I gotta, I gotta
I, I, I, I gotta, I, I, I, I gotta, I, I, I, I gotta
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta
I gotta run, run, run away underneath the thunder
Get, get, get away running from my shadow
Hunt, hunt, hunt me down anywhere you follow
Dark, dark, darker than, darker than my shadow
I'm betting everything I have, as I play Russian roulette
With my own silhouette, with my own silhouette
On and on I go
I run and run but no
I'm never faster than, faster than my shadow
I gotta run, run, run away underneath the thunder
Get, get, get away running from my shadow
Hunt, hunt, hunt me down anywhere you follow
Dark, dark, darker than, darker than my shadow
I'm betting everything I have, as I play Russian roulette
With my own silhouette, with my own silhouette
I'm betting everything I have, as I play Russian roulette
With my own silhouette, with my own silhouette
On and on I go
I run and run but no
I'm never faster than, faster than my shadow
It ain't easy, it ain't easy to be me
Every little thing is gonna get me, oh it's hard to believe
It ain't easy, it ain't easy to be me
Every little thing is gonna get me, oh it's hard to believe
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
A little song will cheer me up
When I'm feeling down and lost
A little song will cheer me up
A little song to make me
It ain't easy, it ain't easy to be me
Every little thing is gonna get me, oh it's hard to believe
It ain't easy, it ain't easy to be me
Every little thing is gonna get me
Money make the world go 'round
